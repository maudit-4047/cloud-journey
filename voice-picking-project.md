Project Overview: Cloud-Based Voice Picking System
What Is It?
A system for warehouse staff to:

Log in with voice or PIN

Get picking instructions via voice (TTS)

Confirm tasks with voice commands (STT)

Track team assignments, workload, and fatigue

Store all data, logs, and analytics in the cloud

Modern Cloud Features:
Microservices or serverless (Lambda/API Gateway)

Uses AWS for hosting, storage, and analytics

Python for scripting, automation, and logic

GitHub for version control and documentation

Key Components & AWS Services to Use
Feature	AWS Service / Tool	Why/How
Voice-to-text (STT)	Amazon Transcribe	Convert spoken input to text
Text-to-speech (TTS)	Amazon Polly	Read picking instructions aloud
Authentication	Amazon Cognito / IAM	User logins, PIN management
Workflow API	API Gateway + Lambda	Business logic in Python
Data storage	DynamoDB or RDS	Store user/team/task/workload info
Analytics/Reports	QuickSight/Athena/S3	Track productivity, fatigue
App frontend	Web: React/HTML or mobile	Simple dashboard for management
Team management	DynamoDB + Lambda	Update and track teams/workloads
Event handling	SNS/SQS	Notifications, order assignment
Logging & Monitoring	CloudWatch	Track errors, events

MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features:
User Login: PIN or username (voice login = stretch goal)

Assign Orders to Teams: Each user belongs to a team (manually or auto-assign)

Voice Picking:

System gives picking instructions (using Polly TTS)

User confirms with a voice response (using Transcribe STT)

Workload Tracking:

Track picks per user/team, suggest rest or change tasks based on fatigue rules

Basic Dashboard:

Simple web page or terminal output for supervisors to see progress/workload

How to Document This Project (for GitHub & Job Interviews):
README.md: Clear description, architecture diagram, “How to Run”, sample API calls

/docs folder: Detailed design notes, user stories, and feature roadmap

/src folder: All your code (Python scripts, Lambda functions, front-end if any)

/infra folder: Terraform/CloudFormation/IaC templates

Project Plan & Timeline Example
Phase	Week	Milestone
Planning	1	Requirements, diagram, repo setup
Backend API	2–3	Lambda/API Gateway, DynamoDB models
Voice Features	4–5	Integrate Polly (TTS), Transcribe (STT)
Workload Mgmt	6	Implement workload & fatigue logic
Dashboard	7	Basic frontend or admin CLI
Analytics	8	Export data to S3/Athena, simple reports
Polish & Docs	9	README, diagrams, sample data, deployment docs
Final Demo	10	End-to-end test, LinkedIn post

Why Is This Awesome for Your Career?
Shows real AWS skills (serverless, DynamoDB, analytics)

Python scripting and Lambda automation

Voice tech (very hot in warehousing/logistics)

Documentation—proves you can deliver a project, not just code
